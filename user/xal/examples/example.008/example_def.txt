# Example : example.008

# Description
This example shows TTNoC functions

# Partition definition
There are two partitions on node 0 and node1.
P0 will open a ttnoc port and exchange messages with the node 1.
P1 obtains information from a remote node and send commands to change the status of remote partitions and hypervisor.

# Configuration table
Basic configuration. Partitions are defined to be executed at different memory addresses.

Two scheduling plan is defined under the following premises:

Plan 0:
MAF = 1000 msec 		
P0: S   0 ms  D 500 ms  
P1: S 500 ms  D 500 ms  

Plan 1:
MAF = 1000 msec
P1: S 500 ms  D 500 ms

# Expected results
\xm{} will load, initialise and run in user mode the partitions. 
During the execution, P0 exchanges messages with node 1.
P1 obtain information about remote node 1, changes the status of the remote partition 0. switches the scheduling plan and
changes the status of the remote hypervisor.
